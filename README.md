# Why it's possible to get negative return when you're making money? 

## Modified Dietz vs. Time Weighted Return.

To calculate your portfolio performance, you just take the ending value minus your beginning value and divide by your beginning value.

That's the naive calculation.

In practice, where I came from, investors tend to add or withdraw cash from their portfolio.

Your $1,000 starting investment is too small to make any meaningful change to your life. 

Let's say you add $5,000 to your investment portfolio.

Does this equate to a 500% profit in your portfolio? 

A porfolio that has cash flow requires a different way to calculate performance. There are 2 calculation methodologies:

1. Modified Dietz return (or value weighted return)
2. Time weighted return

## Does it matter if you choose either one? 

Yes. In fact, your percentage return can be very different. 

One can give you positive return, but the other methodology can show you negative return.

I've created this visualization to illustrated this.
